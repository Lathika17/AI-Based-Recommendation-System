*DESCRIPTION*: This Java-based AI Recommendation System demonstrates a simple content-based and similarity-based filtering technique to suggest products to users based on their preferences. Developed using the standard Java Collections Framework (such as HashMap, List, Set, and ArrayList) and executable on platforms like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or any Java-supported environment, the program stores user-product interactions and compares the target user with others to identify similar interests. By checking for overlapping liked items, the system recommends additional products that similar users prefer—mimicking the basic logic used in real-world recommendation engines. This type of system is widely applicable in e-commerce platforms, movie or music recommendation apps, personalized content delivery systems, and AI-driven product suggestion tools.
